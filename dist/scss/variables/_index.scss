/// Variables Module
/// ===========================================================================
/// 
/// This module consolidates and forwards SCSS partials that define variables
/// for consistent use throughout the project. Each forwarded file encapsulates
/// a specific category of variables, ensuring modularity, clarity, and ease of
/// maintenance.
/// 
/// Forwarded Modules Overview:
/// - `layer`: Variables related to layout layers and z-indexing.
/// - `paper`: Defines color palettes, textures, and backgrounds.
/// - `unit`: Measurement units, spacing, and size-related variables.
/// - `scale`: Scaling factors for typography and responsive elements.
/// - `view`: Variables tied to viewport-specific breakpoints.
/// - `device`: Device-specific configurations to enhance responsive design.
/// - `color`: Centralized color definitions for consistent theming.
/// - `ratio`: Aspect ratio configurations for responsive elements.
