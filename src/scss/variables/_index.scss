/**
 * @fileoverview Variables Module
 * @description
 * This module consolidates and forwards SCSS partials that define variables
 * for consistent use throughout the project. Each forwarded file encapsulates
 * a specific category of variables, ensuring modularity, clarity, and ease of
 * maintenance.
 * 
 * Forwarded Modules Overview:
 * - `layer`: Variables related to layout layers and z-indexing.
 * - `paper`: Defines color palettes, textures, and backgrounds.
 * - `unit`: Measurement units, spacing, and size-related variables.
 * - `scale`: Scaling factors for typography and responsive elements.
 * - `view`: Variables tied to viewport-specific breakpoints.
 * - `device`: Device-specific configurations to enhance responsive design.
 * - `color`: Centralized color definitions for consistent theming.
 * - `ratio`: Aspect ratio configurations for responsive elements.
